# pentest Oh-My-Zsh theme for pentesters

Oh-my-zsh theme for pentesters which includes the IP address of tun0 and allows for a target IP address for pentest logging.

This is a modified version of the intheloop theme, with IP address of tun0 and allows for a target IP address added for penetration testing logging.

I removed the date and time and added a feature to cat a target_ip.txt file across tabs

Installation:

If you're not already using Zshell, switch to it by opening a terminal and enter: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`. Then logout and login. Don't forget to copy anthing impotant like aliases over from `~/.bashrc` to `~/.zshrc`. Note: Kali Linux uses Zshell by default.

Install Oh My Zsh: https://ohmyz.sh/

Copy the file pentest.zsh-theme to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`

```
cp pentest.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
```

Edit `~/.zshrc` and change the theme from `robbyrussel` to `pentest` near the top, and at the bottom add 
```
alias set_target_ip='_set_target_ip() { echo "$1" > ~/target_ip.txt; source ~/.zshrc}; _set_target_ip'
alias target_ip='cat ~/target_ip.txt'
```
then `source ~/.zshrc`.

Make sure you are on the VPN and run `set_target_ip 10.11.12.13` or if you want the target IP run `target_ip`

By default it's configured to include the IP address of tun0 in your prompt, so change the network adapter in line 13 if needed.

For External network pentests, comment out lines 13 and 14, and uncomment lines 16 and 17 to include your Internet IP address in the prompt.
