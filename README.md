# pentest Oh-My-Zsh theme for pentesters

Oh-my-zsh theme for pentesters which includes the date, time, and IP address for pentest logging.

This is a modified version of the intheloop theme, with date, time, and IP address added for penetration testing logging.

I removed the date and time and added a feature to cat a target_ip.txt file across tabs

Installation:

If you're not already using Zshell, switch to it by opening a terminal and enter: `chsh -s $(which zsh)`. Then logout and login. Don't forget to copy anthing impotant like aliases over from `~/.bashrc` to `~/.zshrc`. Note: Kali Linux uses Zshell by default.

Install Oh My Zsh: https://ohmyz.sh/

Copy the file lpha3ch0.zsh-theme to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`


cp pentest.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
alias set_target_ip='_set_target_ip() { echo "$1" > ~/target_ip.txt;}; _set_target_ip'
alias target_ip='cat ~/target_ip.txt'

Edit `~/.zshrc` and change the theme from `robbyrussel` to `lpha3ch0` near the top, then `source ~/.zshrc`.

By default it's configured to include the IP address of tun0 in your prompt, so change the network adapter in line 13 if needed.

For External network pentests, comment out lines 13 and 14, and uncomment lines 16 and 17 to include your Internet IP address in the prompt.
